# Ask-Iwata-Downloader

## About
Use this tool to download the text from Ask Iwata articles from the Nintendo UK website.

Why the UK website? It's a lot easier to scrape from than the US one. For me, that comes with the downside of having non-American spelling, but if you're British, that should be an upside, I guess.

This WILL NOT work with the U.S. website. Will it work with other languages? I have no idea. Probably not. Hopefully trying to download a page in French won't kill your computer. But hey, that's what open source software is for.

## Usage


First, put in the path where you want to save the file to. It should output as a file called "iwataasks_output.txt" at the path you specify.

Then, simply put in the title of the interview when prompted (this is for you, doesn't actually do anything besides put a name at the start of the text) and include a link to the first page of the interview you want to download. For example, let's say I wanted to download the splatoon interview. I would put in "Splatoon" for the title and "https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Iwata-Asks/Iwata-Asks-Splatoon/Splatoon/1-It-Started-With-Tofu/1-It-Started-With-Tofu-1021365.html" for the link.
